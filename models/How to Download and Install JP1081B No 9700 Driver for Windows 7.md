If you see a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross next to it, it means that the driver is not installed or not working properly.
6. Right-click on the device and select "Update driver software". Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and then "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer". Click on "Have disk" and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file. Select the file named "netrtusb.inf" and click on "Open". Click on "OK" and then "Next". Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
7. Once the installation is done, you should see a message saying "Windows has successfully updated your driver software". Click on "Close" and restart your computer.
8. After restarting your computer, you should be able to use your USB to Ethernet adapter with your Windows 7 computer. You can check if it is working by opening Network and Sharing Center and looking for an active network connection named "Local Area Connection". You can also test your internet connection by opening a web browser and visiting any website.

The JP1081B No 9700 driver for Windows 7 is compatible with most USB to Ethernet adapters that use the Corechip RD9700 or QTS1081B chip. However, some adapters may have different device IDs or vendor IDs, which may prevent the driver from being recognized by Windows 7. In that case, you may need to manually modify the driver file to match your adapter's device ID and vendor ID. You can find these IDs by looking at the properties of your adapter in Device Manager.
 
To modify the driver file, you will need a text editor, such as Notepad or Notepad++. Open the file named "netrtusb.inf" in your text editor and look for the section that starts with "[Manufacturer]". Under this section, you will see a list of device names and device IDs. For example, you may see something like this:

    %RD9700.DeviceDesc% = RD9700.ndi, USB\VID_0FE6&PID_9700
    %RD9700.DeviceDesc% = RD9700.ndi, USB\VID_0FE6&PID_9702&MI_01

The first part of each line is the device name, and the second part is the device ID. The device ID consists of four parts: USB\VID\_xxxx&PID\_xxxx&MI\_xx. The VID stands for vendor ID, and the PID stands for product ID. The MI stands for multiple interface, and it is optional. You need to find the device ID that matches your adapter's device ID. If you cannot find it, you can add a new line with your adapter's device ID and device name. For example, if your adapter has a device ID of USB\VID\_1234&PID\_5678, you can add a line like this:

    %RD9700.DeviceDesc% = RD9700.ndi, USB\VID_1234&PID_5678

You can use any device name you want, as long as it matches the one in the next section of the file. Save the file and follow the steps above to install the driver.
 
If you have any trouble modifying the driver file or installing the driver, you can also try using a third-party software that can automatically detect and install drivers for your devices. One such software is DriverPack Solution, which you can download from [this website](https://driverpack.io/en). DriverPack Solution can scan your computer and find the best drivers for your devices.
